The codebase should be fairly easy to understand. I have tried to make the code self-documenting.

I will be adding comments, whenever working on that section of the code.

It uses [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/best-practices?view=aspnetcore-8.0) framework for web services and the [Orleans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/orleans/) Distributed Actor model.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/introduction/) is the primary database.

If you are fluent in languages other than English. Hit me up.
